# Errors: Skpaarab1 message sending algorithm can report send request errors for a variety of reasons. Find out more below.

## HttpError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.
- **Cause** This error message means that the system encountered a problem when attempting to load or send content. It is likely related to The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism gives web servers cross-domain access controls, which enable secure cross-domain data transfers. Modern browsers use CORS in an API container - such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch - to mitigate risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.
- **What it means** Your message has likely gotten through, but you should check at the [server backend](https://github.com/Skparab1/server/actions/workflows/main.yml)
